# System-Program

Managing Assembly / Machine code level language

## Linux
- Used virtualBox to install an Ubuntu virtual machine
- This was the basis for doing most of the tasks such as decyphering
- Learning to manage bits as well

## Book
- Title: **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective**
- Edition: 3rd
- Author: **Randal E. Bryant & David R. O'Hallaron**
